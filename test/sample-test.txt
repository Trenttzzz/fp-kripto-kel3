Hello, World!

This is a sample text file for testing the HMAC File Uploader and Verifier system.

Features to test:
1. Upload this file with a secret key
2. Download the file and verify its integrity
3. Try tampering with the file to see HMAC verification fail
4. Use the CLI tool to verify files locally

This demonstrates how HMAC-SHA256 can ensure data integrity and authenticity.
